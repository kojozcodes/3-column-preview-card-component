## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got to learn how bootstrap forces a some styles on HTML tags, so I had to remove that class and put my own styles. From that I learnt how that I should not always rely on bootstrap, and knowing HTML and CSS helps you a lot when you get stuck in some situations.

### Continued development

I would love to focus on making a web page responsive. I am choosing to follow the mobile first webflow.
